# Nuclei Image Segmentation Using Deep Neural Networks
### INF552 Project [2017-2018]

### Semantic Segmentation Algorithms Investigated on the 2018 Kaggle Data Science Bowl Dataset
---

- This respository  aims to investigate the effectiveness of the current cutting edge neural network 
architectures in the semantic segmentations domain.
- We achieved an accuracy score of **0.398** on the 2018 Kaggle Data Science Bowl which places us at **271st** position
on the private leaderboard.
- Mask-RCNN was found to be the most suitable architecture for this dataset.
